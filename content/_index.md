## About Us

Founded in April 2020, the TCN Coalition is a global community of technologists united by the mission to support exposure notification apps during the COVID-19 pandemic. The TCN Coalition believes that exposure notification apps must be interoperable, trusted by the public, and privacy-preserving to quickly and safely reduce the need for lockdowns. 

We achieve this mission through several programs: connecting and educating app developers about navigating the public health environment, assisting public health agencies in understanding how to deploy this technology safely and effectively, and supporting exposure notification apps with open source software.

## The Challenge

A large number of organizations have sprung up to either enable or build out exposure notification applications since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.

These organizat ions span the globe and many of them have overlapping missions and work. On top of that, they are largely focused on their own product and are not thinking about the broader ecosystem, including how interoperability between these systems might work. 

The TCN Coalition serves as a gathering place for the overall effort. We increase visibility across the ecosystem, allowing for better communication, more effective use of resources, and faster delivery of effective exposure notification solutions as a result.
